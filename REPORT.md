# Copilot Metrics Report — Orders Management API (Spring Boot, Java 21, Gradle)

## Project summary
- Stack: Java 21, Spring Boot 4.0.2, Gradle (`./gradlew`), Spring WebMVC, Spring Data JPA, Validation, H2
- Scope delivered: `POST /orders`, `GET /orders` with pagination + filters (status, amount range, dateFrom/dateTo), seed data, MockMvc tests, JaCoCo coverage, README
- Repo customization: added `.github/` Copilot instructions/prompts and agent/skill docs to standardize Copilot usage

## Metrics (estimated)
| Metric | Value | How measured |
|---|---:|---|
| **Copilot contribution %** | **~90%** | Self-estimated: after manual bootstrap, most implementation (structure, API code, filters, tests, README, seed logic) was generated via Copilot and then reviewed/edited. |
| **Acceptance rate** | **~80%** | Self-estimated: most suggestions were accepted with small edits; a minority were rejected or rewritten (primarily tests and Spring Boot 4 MockMvc setup). |
| **Estimated time saved** | **~2–3 hours** | Self-estimated: total time spent ~1.5h; comparable implementation without Copilot would likely take ~3.5–4.5h given API + filtering + tests + docs. |

## What was generated vs what was manual

### Manual work (intentional)
1) **Initial bootstrap only:** created a “blank” Spring Boot Web project via Spring Initializr (`spring.io`) and configured Java 21 + Gradle wrapper.
2) **Repository Copilot governance:** manually added `.github/` instructions and prompt files (to guide Copilot behavior). The content of these `.md` files was generated with ChatGPT and then committed manually into the project.
3) A few small fixes while reviewing Copilot output (see below).

### Generated mainly by Copilot (majority of the project)
- Project structure creation (packages, folders, initial class layout)
- Domain model (`Order`, `OrderStatus`) and repository setup
- Controller + service logic for:
    - `POST /orders` (validation, 201 Created)
    - `GET /orders` (pagination metadata + response shape)
- Filtering implementation (status, min/max amount, dateFrom/dateTo) using JPA-friendly approach
- Seed logic for sample orders
- MockMvc tests (bulk of the suite)
- README (installation/run instructions + endpoint examples)

## Manual fixes / adjustments
- **Test fixes (bugs):** corrected a couple of failing tests generated by Copilot (assertions/expected counts/edge-case handling).
- **Spring Boot 4 MockMvc configuration:** added missing pieces so `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` works correctly in Spring Boot 4 (module/import differences vs Boot 3).
- Minor cleanup: removed duplicate test dependency entry, ensured Gradle tasks run cleanly.

## 3 key learnings (when Copilot helped vs struggled)
1) **Copilot is excellent for scaffolding and repetitive code**
    - Creating package structure, DTOs, controller/service wiring, and large portions of tests was significantly faster than writing manually.

2) **Copilot struggles with framework/version-specific details**
    - Spring Boot 4 specifics (MockMvc auto-config module + annotation import changes) required manual correction and verification via Gradle build/test.

3) **Copilot output still needs human review for correctness (especially tests)**
    - The fastest path was: generate → run `./gradlew test` → fix failing assertions/edge cases. Copilot accelerated most of the work, but correctness came from running tests and making small manual fixes.

## Evidence / verification
- Tests: `./gradlew test`
- Run app: `./gradlew bootRun`
- Coverage: `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` (HTML: `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`)
